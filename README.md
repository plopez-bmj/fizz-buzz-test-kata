# Fizz-buzz test kata

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz".

In this kata you will have to write a set of unit tests to cover the FizzBuzz class which is a number calculator.

### Exercise 2

Once you have tested and maybe improved the NumberCalculator, write a NumberPrinter class to print all the numbers up to a limit. Use TDD to do this.

Assumptions:

The limit is an integer and is a parameter for your NumberPrinter

### Exercise 3

Encapsulate the printing functionality in your NumberPrinter and then mock it out of your test.
Can you do the same with the NumberCalculator?

Hint: remember to use verify

### Extra

Try to create a different implementation of the NumberCalculator. Invent your own rules.

Do you need to adjust your tests?
